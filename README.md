# Blackjack

A simple Blackjack game made in Visual Studio.

In Blackjack, you play against the dealer. Your goal is to draw cards with a value as close to 21 as possible without going over. A hand that goes over 21 is a bust or break.

This mini-game was done in about 3 hours. It was made by me, I started studying C# earlier this week but I have knowledge about programming itself.
